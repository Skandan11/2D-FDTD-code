# 2D-FDTD-code

2-D MATLAB code to compute E-field movies for simple-shaped geometries such as circles and rectangles. This code is my way of sharpening my MATLAB skills whie learning the underlying theory of FDTD. 

The code obviously needs some cleaning up, which I intend to do in the future. 

Next steps include extending this code to 3-D.

Code written entirely by me, following the lecture series by Prof. Raymond Rumpf at UT El Paso.
